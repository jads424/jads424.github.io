class="c3"><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c1">Cordelia (Should You Gasp When Hot Oil Burns You?)</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c1">Cordelia is a manager at a cheap restaurant, the kind of place with grease-spattered walls and a constant stream of impatient customers. &nbsp;All day she stands on her feet and yells at the other employees, in an effort to keep them producing food as fast as they take orders. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s good at it, and the restaurant she manages is therefore successful, but none of the other employees stay very long. &nbsp;They complain about their boss, that she is tough and strict and unforgiving, that she crushes their self-esteem with crude blows like a hammer, and because of this they call Cordelia &ldquo;The Hammer&rdquo; behind her back. &nbsp;Sometimes she is so nasty to them that they cry. &nbsp;Some of them throw down their aprons in the middle of their shift, run out of the restaurant, and never come back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say that they hate Cordelia because she is mean. &nbsp;But that isn&rsquo;t true. &nbsp;They hate her because she doesn&rsquo;t seem human to them. &nbsp;She doesn&rsquo;t laugh, and she doesn&rsquo;t tell stories. &nbsp;She never says something like, &ldquo;I visited my brother for the holiday&rdquo; or &ldquo;I went to a show this weekend&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried; my kitten seems to be sick.&rdquo; &nbsp;When the hot oil they use for cooking splashes onto Cordelia&rsquo;s hands, she doesn&rsquo;t gasp or curse. &nbsp;She doesn&rsquo;t even flinch; it&rsquo;s like she can&rsquo;t feel it. &nbsp;And when someone yells back at her, she is passive, as if she can&rsquo;t hear it. &nbsp;She seems to be sheltered, cut off from the world, by some invisible wall. &nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a hammer in the world that can strike a blow to &lsquo;The Hammer,&rsquo;&rdquo; her workers think to themselves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Cordelia was young once, like everyone. &nbsp;She laughed, and she told stories, and she gasped if hot oil burned her hands. &nbsp;And she was in love once. &nbsp;Only once. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s never told anyone the story, because she stopped telling stories afterward. &nbsp;But you&rsquo;re curious; you want to know, don&rsquo;t you? &nbsp;And maybe you should know. &nbsp;After all, if you ever end up working in her restaurant, maybe it will make her seem more human to you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cordelia&rsquo;s closest girl friend had a friend, a young man Cordelia had only met a few times. &nbsp;She knew nothing about him, except that he had dark hair and green eyes and that whenever she saw him smile her heart clenched up. &nbsp;He was intelligent and witty, and when he talked, he had the confidence of a man who is no longer a boy, but who has never yet felt how merciless life can be. &nbsp;Whenever Cordelia spoke to him, she only wanted to make him laugh, but she never even considered trying to go after him. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, the young man told Cordelia&rsquo;s friend (the girl, who lived just down the street from Cordelia) that he had never seen the ocean but always wanted to, and he had finally decided to go see it, before he left for his new job in the big city in a few weeks. &nbsp;He might like someone to drive out to the ocean with him. &nbsp;Cordelia had grown up in farm country and in cookie-cutter suburbs, far from the ocean, and she had never seen it either. &nbsp;Somehow &mdash; no one was ever quite sure how it happened &mdash; it was arranged that Cordelia would set out to go lay eyes on the ocean with the young man. &nbsp;Cordelia&rsquo;s mother ruled the house with an iron fist, and Cordelia had never even spent a night away from home on her own, but somehow, just this once, everything fell into place as easily as if it were destiny. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a whole day to drive to the ocean, so they talked in the car all day. &nbsp;They talked about all the things that strangers falling in love in a hurry will talk about &mdash; about their families, the first time they got drunk, their future plans, coquettish accounts of mildly embarrassing things they&rsquo;d done, ethical dilemmas and political leanings, whether an afterlife exists, pet peeves. &nbsp;And during that day they began to fall in love with each other. &nbsp;The truth is that it&rsquo;s easiest to fall for someone before you really know each other, before you&rsquo;ve heard them tell the same story seven times, before you can predict the comments they&rsquo;ll make about politics, before you&rsquo;ve seen them struggle to take off their pants when they are drunk, before you know exactly how it is that they will break your heart. &nbsp;Before they even got all the way to the ocean they knew they would love it, that it would be the most breathtaking sight they&rsquo;d ever seen. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They passed rolling hills of fertile farmland, speeding through the loamy-smelling, humid air of the cornfields. &nbsp;Then the air dried out and great chasms appeared in the earth, as if the devils of the world were straining to break through these pressure fissures, threatening to loom up and swallow the placid farmland. &nbsp;They drove through a desert of towering, jagged rock spires, as awe-inspiring as they were ugly, and the great hungry jaws of the canyons. &nbsp;The whole desert was built of nothing but carefully molded powdery red dust, which left a fine red coating across everything: the steering wheel of the car, the spaces between their toes, the lining of their lungs. &nbsp;Finally the cactus and sagebrush were replaced with scraggly trees, and then bigger trees when they came to a river. &nbsp;On the other side of the river were the most exotic plants they&rsquo;d seen: huge bushes of thin, razor-sharp green spears, less arid cacti bending under the weight of their pink and yellow blooms, and then a whole row of soft purple jacaranda trees. &nbsp;At last they saw the palms, two kinds of them. &nbsp;There were the royal palms, with thick trunks and dense fronds that called to mind Polynesian kings and human sacrifices and volcanoes, and there were the coconut palms, that called to mind Hollywood and movie stars. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was late when they finally arrived at the coast. &nbsp;The night was dark and thrillingly full of stars, with a gentle but restless breeze. &nbsp;The humid air was hung with a wild, briny smell, the smell of something new and untamed. &nbsp;They drove right up close to the beach, but because it was so dark, they figured they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see it and so would wait until morning to walk down to the water&rsquo;s edge. &nbsp;They both were tired from all the newness of the day, so they lay down in the back of his car in a heap of blankets. &nbsp;The space was a little cramped, but secretly they were both excited by the excuse to cuddle up. &nbsp;She lay down with one of his arms under her neck and his other arm holding her close, and breathed in the scent of his body mingled with the ocean air. &nbsp;He rolled down the window, and they heard the waves rhythmically pounding the shore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he kissed her. &nbsp;Softly at first, and then with an intensity which betrayed his feelings. &nbsp;When they kissed, each one felt it was a confirmation that the other was also falling in love. &nbsp;They pressed against each other ravenously. &nbsp;And then, not because they were in a hurry but simply because the world had never felt so right as it did that night, they made love. &nbsp;Neither of them was a virgin, but neither one had ever made love before. &nbsp;They had only fucked, learned the motions, fooled around. &nbsp;They made love in a rhythm which harmonized with the rhythm of the ocean waves hitting the shore. &nbsp;Her orgasm swept through her body like a tidal wave. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, they awoke to the sound of the waves, still feeling that rhythm somewhere deep in their bodies. &nbsp;It was early in the morning, but the sun was already bursting down onto the earth, warm and exuberant. &nbsp;The lovers ran down to the shore, laughing aloud with the kind of joy that only young lovers can feel. &nbsp;They stopped just shy of the water, open-mouthed with awe at the vastness of the ocean. &nbsp;It was an admirably frivolous sort of vastness, as if God had been showing off how sweeping his strokes of creation could be, like a man tossing out fistfuls of coins to show off his wealth. &nbsp;Cordelia was surprised to find that the ocean was more than just water and sand. &nbsp;Kelp floated in the water and huddled in alien masses on the white sand punctuated by little holes that crabs crawled out of. &nbsp;Everything was alive, breathing, moving. &nbsp;Plovers ventured up to the waves and darted away at the last minute, before the wave churned up a fresh batch of kelp and shells and rocks. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cordelia looked out over the ocean, but the young man bent down to pick a shell out of the sand. &nbsp;It was a whitish-pink spiraled shell, a little smaller than Cordelia&rsquo;s fist. &nbsp;He held it out to Cordelia, who took it and inspected it carefully. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I wonder what lived in here?&rdquo; she asked. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Something fragile, I&rsquo;d imagine, that needed those walls to protect it,&rdquo; he replied absentmindedly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cordelia gazed out over the ocean again, then down back at the shell in her hand, imagining some little sea creature hiding away in a shell at the bottom of all this water. &nbsp;She ran her finger over the shell&rsquo;s roughly polished edges. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Are you going to keep it?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded and took his hand, and they walked down the beach for an hour or two. &nbsp;The sky clouded over a little, the wind picked up, and it began to rain a little, not ominously but invigoratingly. &nbsp;The rain chased the handful of other early-morning beachgoers away, and the lovers found themselves alone on the edge of the world. &nbsp;They lay down in the wet sand and made love again, in the drizzle, without a thought to the possibility of someone walking by. &nbsp;Afterwards they held each other, panting lightly, unaware of the past or the future. &nbsp;Their whole lives were only this moment, until they looked out over the ocean. &nbsp;It spread out before them, incomprehensibly enormous, and it made them aware of the future. &nbsp;Their future was as vast as this water, as deep and endless. &nbsp;They fell asleep for a few minutes, and when she woke up first, she thought about what words to wake him up with. &nbsp;She wanted to tell him she loved him, because she could feel nothing at all but the tight plunging thrill of falling in love, but she was worried he would think it was too soon. &nbsp;She fingered the seashell he had given her while she thought about what to say. &nbsp;Finally, she bent over his face, which made her feel mesmerized with tenderness, and said softly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy we&rsquo;re here together.&rdquo; &nbsp;He opened his green eyes wide with the surprise of being awakened and said groggily, &ldquo;Your voice sounds just like the ocean.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long they stayed at the ocean, Cordelia can&rsquo;t remember. &nbsp;It felt like weeks or months, a lifetime maybe, as long as it takes to learn another person&rsquo;s soul. &nbsp;But of course Cordelia knows, rationally, that it was probably only a day or two, a long weekend at most. &nbsp;Three or four days that cast a shadow over the rest of her life. &nbsp;How could a handful of days, days without deaths or births or other such drama, be the defining moments of her life? &nbsp;Sometimes she wonders if it was really love at all, or just a cheap copy, but it&rsquo;s hard to really judge, because it&rsquo;s the closest she&rsquo;s ever come to being in love. &nbsp;On the day they left the ocean, just before they crossed the state line, they pulled over for lunch. &nbsp;After lunch, they kissed for a while, and then he told her things no boy had ever told her before: how beautiful she was, how intelligent and free-spirited. &nbsp;He told her he loved her. &nbsp;She let go of the emotion she&rsquo;d been holding back and told him how she adored him and how he&rsquo;d enriched her life in just a few days. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, their little journey to the ocean wasn&rsquo;t the end of their being lovers. &nbsp;But it was the only part that mattered. &nbsp;They had another two weeks after they came back. &nbsp;She would go over to his house, or he would pick her up in his car and they would lie down in the backseat, but it wasn&rsquo;t quite the same. &nbsp;They were back in the real world, where feelings are not simple or pure, love and sex are not the same thing, and having chatted with someone while driving for two days doesn&rsquo;t mean they aren&rsquo;t a stranger to you. &nbsp;After two weeks, he left for his prestigious new job in the city. &nbsp;She wrote him a sweet letter, wishing him well but saying she missed him and looked forward to traveling with him again and making love to him when they saw each other. &nbsp;He responded with a letter in which he said he was sorry for perhaps having misled her, but he was building a career and could not divert any attention to having a girlfriend. &nbsp;Moreover, he had been caught up in the fun of their trip to the ocean, and while he admired her deeply as a friend, he had not loved her nor found her particularly attractive, and he regretted the serious tone she had given to what she should have seen as merely a sweet little fling. &nbsp;However, he repeated, he held her in deep esteem, and looked forward to her company when he came home for Christmas. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was quietly devastated. &nbsp;Silly as it seemed to her, the part that threw her over the edge was the remark about not finding her attractive. &nbsp;She wasn&rsquo;t self-conscious about her looks, but she felt that he was purposely adding insult to injury. &nbsp;That he didn&rsquo;t love her had to be admitted; that he hadn&rsquo;t found her beautiful was unnecessary, and she didn&rsquo;t believe it anyway. &nbsp;It was only there to hurt her. &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t cry about it or tell her friends the sad story, but she couldn&rsquo;t get over him either. &nbsp;She sent him another letter, a timidly platonic one. &nbsp;His failure to respond only increased her longing. &nbsp;She couldn&rsquo;t sleep at night, imagining his laugh or his body or the ocean. &nbsp;When he came home for Christmas, she discovered that neither one of them wanted friendship. &nbsp;She wanted love, and he wanted sex and power. &nbsp;They had sex several times, but only when he wanted it. &nbsp;She still enjoyed it, but she knew they were only fucking, not making love. &nbsp;Her unbearable, indestructible, unrequited love for him tormented her, and his recklessness with her feelings angered her, but she longed for him too much to hate him, so instead she began to hate everyone and everything else. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she moved to a different big city a few months later to look for a job, she sent him a brief note with her mailing address. &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t expect a reply from him and didn&rsquo;t get one, and that was that. &nbsp;They never spoke again. &nbsp;But she couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking of him on the beach, naked and virile and grinning at her. &nbsp;It became a habit to think of him while she was falling asleep, or when she let her mind wander while she was at work, or when she was just lonely. &nbsp;She began to drown in her longing, which was as vast as the ocean which she&rsquo;d once mistaken for a future. &nbsp;Her longing was not for him as he was, but for whoever she&rsquo;d thought he was when they went to the ocean together. &nbsp;It didn&rsquo;t matter anymore whether that man had ever even existed. &nbsp;To protect her fantasy and her hurt ego and her destroyed belief in romance, she built walls around herself. &nbsp;She no longer laughed or told stories or gasped when hot oil burned her hands. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, like almost any sorrow in the world, Cordelia&rsquo;s lessened and nearly vanished with time. &nbsp;For the first year she thought of him constantly, for the next six months she thought of him often, and after that, she only thought of him occasionally, when something reminded her of him. &nbsp;She was over him at last, but she couldn&rsquo;t tear down the walls she&rsquo;d built around herself. &nbsp;They stayed up, no longer to protect him, but because of the high costs of demolition. &nbsp;She was worried about paychecks and rent and whether she could afford maintenance on her car, not about romance or friendships. &nbsp;It was easier all around to leave the walls up. &nbsp;They served her well, in many ways: when she lost her job and therefore her car, they kept her from breaking down (for people who don&rsquo;t laugh don&rsquo;t cry either) and helped her march stoically into the new job she found. &nbsp;Cordelia worked her way up; she is thirty-six now and makes a comfortable middle-class salary. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s a bitch at work, but she&rsquo;s softened up a little in her personal life. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s had a couple of boyfriends, kind young men who cared for her deeply. &nbsp;A few years ago she married a sweet young man. &nbsp;He was a good friend, but she wasn&rsquo;t in love with him, and because of that they never made love; they only fucked. &nbsp;She just wanted to be a little less lonely. &nbsp;Instead, she found that being married without being in love (or even thinking she was in love) made her feel lonelier. &nbsp;She divorced him, but they still keep in touch. &nbsp;She feels better now, at home with her loneliness and a little fond of it, like a stray cat that you let into your house on cold nights to lay at your feet while you pay it no attention. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cordelia just bought a nice apartment downtown. &nbsp;She lives there alone, but there are a few people she likes enough to punch through the walls for and open her door. &nbsp;None of them know too much about her personal life, but they&rsquo;ll come visit her once in a while. &nbsp;When they come over to her apartment, some of them notice the whitish-pink shell, a little smaller than a fist, on the living room windowsill. &nbsp;They don&rsquo;t think much of it; maybe they wonder what small, fragile creature might have built such a shell around itself. &nbsp;Because it feels too strange for a guest to do, they never hold the shell up to their ear. &nbsp;But if they did, they&rsquo;d hear the ocean, and maybe they would think that it sounds just like Cordelia&rsquo;s voice. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p
